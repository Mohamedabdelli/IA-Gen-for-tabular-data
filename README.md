# IA-Gen-for-tabular-data
The project presents the implementation of a candidate classification application using Streamlit deployed on an EC2 instance. The application leverages multiple AWS services, including API Gateway, Lambda, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon S3. 


For more details on the architecture and operation of the application, please refer to my article on Medium: [Utilizing Generative AI for Classification Problems using Streamlit, EC2, API Gateway, Lambda, Amazon Bedrock, and S3](https://medium.com/@abdellimohamedammar/utilizing-generative-ai-for-classification-problems-using-streamlit-ec2-api-gateway-lambda-83c49a64af56).
